 * conditions such as re-prompting and re-trying after an incorrect two
 * factor code is entered.
 *
 * The object acts as a state machine which is stepped through by the caller
 * until the desired action is completed. At each step, the current state can
 * be determined and used to perform the next action required.
 *
 * Some actions require a sequence of codes and decisions; these are hidden
 * behind the state machine interface so that callers do not need to handle
 * special cases or program their own logic to handle any lower level API
 * differences.
 *
 * The state machine has the following states, which are returned in the
 * ``"status"`` element from `GA_auth_handler_get_status`:
 *
 * * ``"done"``: The action has been completed successfully. Any data returned
 *|  from the action is present in the ``"result"`` element of the status JSON.
 *| The auth_handler object should be destroyed using `GA_destroy_auth_handler`
 *| after receiving this status.
 *
 * * ``"error"``: A non-recoverable error occurred performing the action. The
 *| associated error message is given in the status element ``"error"``. The
 *| auth_handler object should be destroyed using `GA_destroy_auth_handler` and
 *| the action restarted from scratch if this state is returned.
 *
 * * ``"request_code"``: Two factor authorization is required. The caller should
 *| prompt the user to choose a two factor method from the ``"methods"`` element
 *| and call `GA_auth_handler_request_code` with the selected method.
 *
 * * ``"resolve_code"``: A twofactor code from the ``"request_code"`` step, or
 *| data from a hardware device is required. If the status JSON contains
 *| :ref:`hw-required-data`, then see :ref:`hw-resolve-overview` for details.
 *| Otherwise, to resolve a twofactor code, the caller should prompt the user
 *| to enter the code from the twofactor method chosen in the ``"request_code"``
 *| step, and pass this code to `GA_auth_handler_resolve_code`.
 *
