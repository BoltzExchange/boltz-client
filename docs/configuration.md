# ðŸŽ› Configuration

`boltz-client` can be configured via a `TOML` config file or CLI arguments. By default, the config file is called `boltz.toml` and located in the data directory of `boltz-client` (`~/.boltz` by default on Linux).

## Example

```toml
# Path to the log file
logfile = ""

[BOLTZ]
# By default the daemon automatically connects to the official Boltz Backend for the network LND is on
# This value is used to overwrite that
url = "https://api.boltz.exchange"

[DATABASE]
# Path to the SQLite database file
path = "/home/me/test.db"

[LND]
# Host of the gRPC interface of LND
host = "127.0.0.1"

# Port of the gRPC interface of LND
port = 10009

# Path to a macaroon file of LND
# The daemon needs to have permission to read various endpoints, generate addresses and pay invoices
macaroon = ""

# Path to the TLS certificate of LND
certificate = ""

[CLN]
# Host of the gRPC interface of CLN
host = "127.0.0.1"

# Port of the gRPC interface of CLN
port = 9736

# Path to the data directory of CLN
datadir = "~/.lightning"

# Paths to TLS certificates and keys of CLN
rootcert = ""
privatekey = ""
certchain =  ""

[RPC]
# Host of the gRPC interface
host = "127.0.0.1"

# Port of the gRPC interface
port = 9002

# Whether the REST proxy for the gRPC interface should be disabled
restDisabled = false

# Host of the REST proxy
restHost = "127.0.0.1"

# Port of the REST proxy
restPort = 9003

# Path to the TLS cert for the gRPC and REST interface
tlsCert = ""

# Path to the TLS private key for the gRPC and REST interface
tlsKey = ""

# Whether the macaroon authentication for the gRPC and REST interface should be disabled
noMacaroons = false

# Path to the admin macaroon for the gRPC and REST interface
adminMacaroonPath = ""

# Path to the read-only macaroon for the gRPC and REST interface
readOnlyMacaroonPath = ""
```
